Search Servlet
-------------
This search is general, so we used the OR functionality. 
For substring matching we used the pattern LIKE %ABC% in order to 
get a general result.


Advanced Search Servlet
-----------------
For this type of search, we used the pattern LIKE %ABC%
for each term (title, year, director, star).
We also used the AND functionality in order to 
get more precise results. 

Browse Results Servlet
----------------
When users browse by title, we used the pattern
LIKE A% because the movies are always listed
by the first letter in the title.
